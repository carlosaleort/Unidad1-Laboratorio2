Step 1: Install URP via the Package Manager
Open your Unity project.
Go to Window > Package Manager.
In the Package Manager, search for Universal RP or Universal Render Pipeline.
Click Install.
Step 2: Set up the Universal Render Pipeline
In the Project window, right-click and go to Create > Rendering > Universal Render Pipeline > Pipeline Asset.
Name it (e.g., "URP_Pipeline").
Then, go to Edit > Project Settings > Graphics.
In the Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings field, assign the URP Pipeline asset you just created.
Step 3: Upgrade Materials to URP
In Edit > Render Pipeline > Universal Render Pipeline, choose Upgrade Project Materials to UniversalRP Materials.
This will convert all your materials to URP-compatible versions.
If needed, you can convert specific materials by right-clicking them in the Project window and selecting Convert Selected Materials to UniversalRP.
Step 4: Adjust Lighting & Post Processing (optional)
URP uses different lighting and post-processing systems than Built-In, so you may need to adjust your lighting setup and add a Post-Processing Volume.
For post-processing, you'll need to install Post Processing from the Package Manager and add it to your URP pipeline settings.
Once you've completed these steps, your project and materials should now be compatible with the URP!
